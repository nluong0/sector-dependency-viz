      <h2>Sector Dependency by County</h2>
      <p>The USDA Economic Research Search (ERS) has codified “six mutually exclusive 
        categories of economic dependence and six overlapping categories of 
        policy-relevant themes” for each county in the United States. Economic 
        dependence types include “farming, mining, manufacturing, Federal/State 
        government, recreation, and non-specialized counties”. Below, you'll be able to explore
        which U.S. counties were dependent on which sectors in 2015 as well as how the 
        socioeconomic variables for counties in each sector-depenency group 
        interact.</p>

      <h3>Definitions</h3>
      <p>
        A <b>manufacturing-dependent</b> county is one where manufacturing accounted for 23% or 
        more of the county's earnings or 16% of the employment averaged over 2010-12.<br>
        <br>
        A <b>farming-dependent</b> county is one where farming accounted for at 25% or more of 
        the county's earnings or 16% or more of the employment averaged over 2010-2012.<br>
        <br>
        A <b>mining-dependent county</b> is one where mining accounted for 13% or more of the 
        county's earnings or 8% of the employment averaged over 2010-12.<br>
        <br>
        A <b>recreation-dependent county</b> is determined by percentage of wage and salary 
        employment in entertainment and recreation, accommodations, eating and drinking 
        places, and real estate as a percentage of all employment reported by the Bureau 
        of Economic Analysis; percentage of total personal income reported for these same 
        categories by the Bureau of Economic Analysis; and percentage of vacant housing 
        units intended for seasonal or occasional use reported in the 2010 Census.<br>
        <br>
        A <b>nonspecialized</b> county is one does not fall into any of the above categories.
