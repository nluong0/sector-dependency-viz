      <h2>Sector Dependency by County</h2>
      <p>The USDA Economic Research Search (ERS) has codified “six mutually exclusive 
        categories of economic dependence and six overlapping categories of 
        policy-relevant themes” for each county in the United States. Economic 
        dependence types include “farming, mining, manufacturing, Federal/State 
        government, recreation, and non-specialized counties”. Policy-relevant 
        types include “low education, low employment, persistent poverty, persistent 
        child poverty, population loss, and retirement destination.” An area's economic 
        dependence can heavily shape its development, need for various types of policy 
        programs or interventions, and business climate.

        Inspecting what socioeconomic and demographic factors correlate with the various
        types of economic dependence can suggest narratives for how those economic 
        dependence came about. Pinpointing the main factors associated with these 
        dependencies help draw relationships between them as well. </p>
